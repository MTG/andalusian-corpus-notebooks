    "With this widget, it is possible to visualise the pitch distribution of a single recording or the overall/average pitch distribution of a nawba. Pitch distribution can be compared with note distribution on the correspondent transcription of the score or, in an overall/average notes distribution. Pitch distributions are centred by using a tonic frequency computed in different ways. With the options, it is possible to: (1) select the nawba to analyse, (2) centre the plot in three octaves, and (3) fold the plot in one octave. After the selection of graph types and options, they will be showed by pressing the \"Run Interact\" button."
